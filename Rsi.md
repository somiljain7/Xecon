#STEPS TO CALCULATE RSI:

1.Observe the last 14 closing prices of a stock.
2.Determine whether the current day’s closing price is higher or lower than the previous day.
3.Calculate the average gain and loss over the last 14 days.
4.Compute the relative strength (RS): (AvgGain/AvgLoss)
5.Compute the relative strength index (RSI): (100–100 / ( 1 + RS))
