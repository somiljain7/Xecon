A simple moving average is a technical indicator that can aid in determining if an asset price will continue or if it will reverse a bull or bear trend.

# Simple Moving Average (SMA) takes the average over some set number of time periods. So a 10 period SMA would be over 10 periods (usually meaning 10 trading days).
