Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a wee bit more involved. First, you should find the SMA. Second, calculate the smoothing factor. Then, use your smoothing factor with the previous EMA to find a new value. In this way, the latest prices are given higher weights, whereas the SMA assigns equal weight to all periods.
